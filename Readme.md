Simple Malware Scanner Project:

This is a simple malware scanner implemented in Python using tkinter for the GUI, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and hashlib for hashing files. This tool allows users to import a file and scan it for malware by comparing its hash against known malicious hashes from an online database.
Instructions:

    Scan Options:
        Scan Online: Check this option to scan the file against an online database.
        Scan Offline: Check this option to scan the file against a local database.
        Remove File: Check this option to automatically remove the file if it's identified as malicious.

    Import File:
        Click the "Import file" button to select the file you want to scan.

    Results:
        The results will be displayed in the GUI.
        If the file is identified as malicious and the "Remove File" option is checked, it will be deleted automatically.

Notes:

    Ensure an active internet connection for online scanning.
    This tool compares file hashes with known malicious hashes from the online and/or offline database.
    For offline scanning, ensure that the full_sha256.txt file is available in the working directory.

Usage:

    Run the script.
    Check the desired scan options.
    Click "Import file" and select the file to scan.
    View the scan results in the GUI.

Dependencies:

    Python 3.x
